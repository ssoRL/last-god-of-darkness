        <h1>Acknowledgments</h1>
        <p>
            I would like to thanks the following people for the assistance they provided 
            in creating this project:
        </p>
        <p>
            Rafael Salda√±a for creating the glyphs used as page breaks. These are provided
            free to use at <a href="https://fontmeme.com/fonts/mayan-glyphs-font/">Font Meme</a>
            and <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/ikarusmedia/art/mayan-glyphs-vector-290487205">Deviant Art</a>.
            Based on the work of Eric S. Thompson at <a href="http://www.famsi.org">FAMSI</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The maintainers of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked">marked</a>
             and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server">http-server</a> projects,
             as well as their numerous node dependencies. The work of converting all that text
            into html would have been unthinkable otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            And of course Julia Schertzer for the many rounds of copy editing she provided
            for me. This story wouldn't be what it is without her feedback, love and
            support.
        </p>
