        <p>
            I would like to thanks the following people for the assistance they provided 
            in creating this project:
        </p>
        <p>
            Rafael Salda√±a for creating the glyphs used as page breaks. These are provided
            free to use at Dingbat () and Deviant Art. Based on the work
            of Eric S. Thompson at FAMSI (http://www.famsi.org).
        </p>
        <p>
            The maintainers of the marked() and http-server() projects, as well as
            their numerous node dependencies. The work of converting all that text
            into html would have been unthinkable otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            And of course Julia Schertzer for the many rounds of copy editing she provided
            for me. This story wouldn't be what it is without her feedback, love and
            support.
        </p>
