        <p class="mainText">As soon as the jeep stops, the heat begins in earnest. It washes through the small vehicle. It feels like being hit with a blast of steam. So hot that my skin stings unpleasantly and so humid I think my clothes might mildew off my body.<br>
        <p class="mainText">The guide gets out of the driver seat and looks ahead. The road is washed out ahead of us, all the earth swept away to expose a section of perhaps twenty feet that was paved with nothing but the underlying rocks. Boulders two or three feet in diameter with similar spaces in between. To our left the jungle rises impassably, a wall of vines and foliage. To our right is a steep drop of forty feet or more. At it's base, more jungle on as far as the eye can see.<br>
        From the backseat, the Professor asks, “Why are we stopped. Can we not get further?”<br>
        I answered, “I don't know. Looks bad though. I'll check.”<br>
        I follow the guide out. It's even hotter with the midday sun beating down. Shielding my eyes, I approach our guide. After some seconds considering what to say, I eventually settle on, “Podemos pasar… eso.” I wave at the field of boulders where the road had been.<br>
        He doesn't answer right away. Instead, he takes a cigarette out of an inner pocket and lights it. As he smokes, he surveys the washout. His eyes dart from rock to rock, imagining our vehicle astride them, tires bouncing over the gaps in between. Finally, after the cigarette is burned down halfway, he turns to me and says, “Sí”<br>
        “Bueno. So, uh, vamos?”<br>
        “Sí”<br>
        We return to the jeep. “He thinks we can get through,” I tell the Professor.<br>
        “Very well. Let's keep on then.”<br>
        The guide restarts the jeep and we roll forward. We creep, inch by inch across the rocks. The guide twists the steering wheel back and forth and presses ever so lightly on the jeep's gas. Each nudge on the gas pedal turns into a lurch forward. I grip the door handle, by knuckles turning white as I imagine one of our tires slipping between the rocks. Grounding us out thirty miles from the nearest settlement. The guide seems only concentrated. Noticing nothing but the road ahead. The cigarette burns down in his mouth and ash drops into his lap.<br>
        A rock below us slips the jeep pitches to the right, towards the drop off. I let out a cry and my fingers dig into the handle, but the guide keeps his head. His foot comes down on the gas and we accelerate forward, bouncing over several boulders. The bottom of the jeep scrapes against the rocks, but it pulls us away from the edge. And just in time. Behind us I see several rocks, at least one of which a tire had rested on, slide off the edge. Several seconds later I hear the percussive crack as they hit the bottom.<br>
        The guide doesn't look outwardly perturbed, but I see that he's bitten most of the way through the filter of his cigarette. I ask, “Bien?”<br>
        He just nods and we keep going. It's only a few more nudges on the gas pedal. A few more sickening lurches, and then we're on the far side, rutted dirt under our wheels. Without looking back, the guide accelerates. Wind rushes in through the open windows, taking away the worst of the heat and clearing the cigarette smoke. As the boulders disappear around a bend in the road, I realized that my heart is pounding and my shirt is drenched with sweat.</p><br>

        <p>There are a couple smaller washouts a few miles further on. But they are not nearly as bad and the guide doesn't stop for them Just keeps the jeep rolling over the exposed rocks. The road rises steadily, but gradually, upwards. On either side, the jungle is overgrowing the road. Vines and branches whip at the windshield as we drive.<br>
        The Professor hardly ever looks up. In the backseat he leafs through pages of notes, bright blue eyes flashing across the pages. From time to time he pulls distractedly on his thick gray beard and mutters to himself.<br>
        The afternoon passes with us driving up the road. Even where the road isn't washed out, we hardly ever break fifteen miles as hour it was so rutted. At three, we get to a fork. To the right, the road drops back down. That one was still used by poachers and loggers from time to time. It's rutted and disintegrating, but the jungle is held, at least for the moment, at bay. To the left, is the road to Santa Gloria. It hasn't been driven in a while. Brush had begun to grown up between the hard packed ruts. A thin surface of moss has begun to form. Thin branches sometimes stretched clear across the road.<br>
        We turned left. Brush crunching under our wheels. Branches snapping on our windshield. From time to time now, we have to stop. The Guide and I exit, and with our machetes, clear out some particularly thick growth before we can keep driving.<br>
        Then, at around seven, we come around a bend. The sun has been obscured by the forest for some time, but here another cliff appears to our right, facing west, and slanting rays of light filter into the jeep through the dusty windshield. The guide stops the jeep again and gets out to look at our newest obstacle. I join him.<br>
        The road had once passed close to the edge of the cliff. But now it is gone. Washed away in some rain storm in the year or more since anyone has driven this road. There is nothing but the thick wall of foliage on the left and a sheer rock face plunging down on the right. On the far side of the washout, the road continues, but for those thirty feet, there is nothing left.<br>
        From the backseat, the Professor squinting through the windshield shouts, “What's going on? Can we keep going?”<br>
        I turn to our Guide and am choosing verbs out of my limited vocabulary. But he didn't wait for the question. He shook his head and said, “No Puedo manajar mas lejo. Nos quedarémos aqui por la noche, y mañana, vamos a caminar.”<br>
        I turn to the Professor, “Tomorrow, we're walking.”</p>

        From the backseat, the Professor squinting through the windshield shouts, “What's going on? Can we keep going?”<br>
        I turn to our Guide and am choosing verbs out of my limited vocabulary. But he didn't wait for the question. He shook his head and said, “No Puedo manajar mas lejo. Nos quedarémos aqui por la noche, y mañana, vamos a caminar.”<br>
        I turn to the Professor, “Tomorrow, we're walking.”</p>
